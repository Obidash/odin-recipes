            <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 50c. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla essence and almond milk into a bowl and whisk together. Pour into a jug.</li>
                        <li>To make the cinnamon mix, put the butter in the microwave for a few seconds to melt (or melt in a small pan on a medium heat). Pour the melted butter into a bowl along with the sugar and cinnamon and stir to combine. Leave to cool and then transfer to a squeezy bottle or piping bag.</li>
                        <li>Put the ingredients for the icing into a bowl and beat until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Now cook your pancakes! Place the saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add ½ teaspoon of dairy-free butter and allow it to melt. Use a piece of kitchen paper to spread the melted butter around so the pan is fully greased. When the pan is really hot, pour half a cup or a small ladle of pancake mix into the centre.</li>
                        <li>Quickly grab your cinnamon mix and squeeze an even, steady swirl from the centre of the pancake spiraling out to the edge. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, during which time bubbles with appear on the top. Lift up the edge of the pancake with a spatula to check if it’s cooked underneath – if it feels dry and looks golden brown, it’s ready.</li>
                        <li>Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute, until it is perfectly golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Put the pancake on a plate, cover it with a tea towel and put it in the oven. Repeat to make all the pancakes. Remove from the oven and stack ‘em high on a plate. Drizzle artfully with the icing, then pour over lashings of maple syrup and serve.</li>
