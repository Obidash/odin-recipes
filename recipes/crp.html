                <h3>Pancake Mix</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>500g plain flour</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp baking powder</li>
                        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
                        <li>1 litre unsweetened almond milk</li>
                        <li>dairy-free butter, for frying</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Cinnamon Mix</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>120g dairy-free butter</li>
                        <li>190g light brown sugar</li>
                        <li>10g ground cinnamon</li>    
                    </ul>

                <h3>Maple Glaze Icing</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>300g icing sugar</li>
                        <li>50ml maple syrup, plus more for drizzling</li>
                        <li>40ml water</li>
                    </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 50c. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla essence and almond milk into a bowl and whisk together. Pour into a jug.</li>
                    <li>To make the cinnamon mix, put the butter in the microwave for a few seconds to melt (or melt in a small pan on a medium heat). Pour the melted butter into a bowl along with the sugar and cinnamon and stir to combine. Leave to cool and then transfer to a squeezy bottle or piping bag.</li>
                    <li>Put the ingredients for the icing into a bowl and beat until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Now cook your pancakes! Place the saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add ½ teaspoon of dairy-free butter and allow it to melt. Use a piece of kitchen paper to spread the melted butter around so the pan is fully greased. When the pan is really hot, pour half a cup or a small ladle of pancake mix into the centre.</li>
                    <li>Quickly grab your cinnamon mix and squeeze an even, steady swirl from the centre of the pancake spiraling out to the edge. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, during which time bubbles with appear on the top. Lift up the edge of the pancake with a spatula to check if it’s cooked underneath – if it feels dry and looks golden brown, it’s ready.</li>
                    <li>Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute, until it is perfectly golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Put the pancake on a plate, cover it with a tea towel and put it in the oven. Repeat to make all the pancakes. Remove from the oven and stack ‘em high on a plate. Drizzle artfully with the icing, then pour over lashings of maple syrup and serve.</li>
                </ol>
