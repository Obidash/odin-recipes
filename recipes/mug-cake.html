            <div class="text">
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt and baking powder to a mug. Stir or whisk to combine.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla into the mug with the dry ingredients and stir well with a spoon. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.</li>
                    <li>Cook in the microwave for 40 seconds. It will likely be a little undercooked in the middle at this point, which is my preference, but if you want it cooked more, microwave it another 10-20 seconds. </li>
                    <li>Serve immediately. </li>
                </ol>
