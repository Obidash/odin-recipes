            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>This is one of the most delicious vegan pecan pies I've had the pleasure of tasting and I'm so glad I get to share the recipe with you!</p>
                <p>Eggs usually go a long way at holding the filling together, making it difficult to pull off this vegan masterpiece. However with a combination of flax eggs, cornstarch, and the right amount of other liquids and ingredients, creates the key to a filling that thickens and holds together.</p>
                <p>The flavor and texture of this pie are out of this world incredible. It tastes almost like caramel, with a slight hint of bourbon (optional but so good). It’s a pretty sweet pie for sure, and a small slice will totally satisfy.</p>
                <p>While there are many vegan pecan pie recipes out there, there's none that come as close to a traditional pecan pie like this!</p>
                <p>Hope you're ready to dive in and make this culinary marvel!</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Vegan Pie Crust *see Notes for other options</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup dark corn syrup *or maple syrup/brown rice syrup</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons bourbon, optional</li>
                    <li>2 cups coarse chopped pecans (10 oz), + 1/2 cup pecan halves for decorating the top</li>
                </ul>
                    
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare a vegan pie crust (there is no need to pre-bake it) and line a 9 inch pie plate with it. Stick the pie plate with the crust in the refrigerator until ready to fill it. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the flax eggs: In a small bowl, stir together the ground flaxseeds and water, then set aside to let thicken. This is your egg substitute.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, add the melted vegan butter, corn syrup, flax eggs, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and optional bourbon and whisk until well combined and smooth.</li>
                    <li>Roughly chop the 10 oz pecans and have another 1/2 cup halves ready for decorating the top. I like to use my food processor to quickly chop them.</li>
                    <li>Carefully spread the pecans evenly into the unbaked pie crust. Pour the sugar mixture into the pie crust over the pecans, evenly. Alternatively, stir the chopped pecans into the sugar mixture, then pour into the crust.</li>
                    <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake the pie for 50-55 minutes, until thick and bubbly and golden brown. It will still be quite liquidity until it cools so don’t cut into it right away. Use a pie crust shield after 15-20 minutes of baking if the crust starts to burn.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven, sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired, and let cool on a wire rack at room temperature for 30 minutes, then move to the refrigerator. At least 4 hours in the refrigerator is best to let it settle and firm up. Overnight is even better!</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve the pie with coconut whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
