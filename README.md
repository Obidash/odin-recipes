# odin-recipes
Introduction

This project will be a website consiting of a single index page that will have links to some of my favourite recepies.

Implementation
For this project I used entirely HTML to perform the functionality of all the links between pages and images .

Optimizations: (further work required)

Lessons Learned: While referencing image sources in with the src attribute I found that some images did not work even when referencing them in the correct format. I believe that this is most likely due to the addresses I got referring to another source and not being it's own orginal address. Overall I found a work around by tracing back the source image and then it was able to successfully display.

Future Work: While the site navigates between pages well and is able to convey the necessary information for making the various recipes, the pages themselves are rather ugly. For furture work I would want to give the site a more polished look utilizing css. Once I learn the necessary skills I would love to come back and give the site a much needed makeover.
